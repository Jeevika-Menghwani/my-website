            <p>The dataset captures financial and demographic attributes of individuals. Key variables include dependents, monthly credit card expenditure, ownership status, self-employment, and the number of major credit cards.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
            <p>A moderate positive correlation (r=0.318) was observed between income and dependents. Linear regression revealed:</p>
            <p><strong>Income = 2.917 + 0.445 × Dependents</strong></p>
            <p>This suggests that income tends to rise moderately with an increase in dependents.</p>

            <p>A multivariate regression model included significant predictors such as expenditure, ownership status, self-employment, dependents, and major cards. The model had an adjusted R² = 0.2581, explaining 26% of income variability.</p>

                <li><strong>Dependents:</strong> A significant predictor of income but explains only part of its variability.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Factors:</strong> Expenditure, ownership status, and self-employment also play critical roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Influences:</strong> Other unaccounted factors like education and geographic location may further impact income.</li>
